Exploring the openai api and the Web Speech api.

The frontend is a Typescript Create React App with a redux store. Emphasizing reusable components such as basic form, basic alert & basic dialog. With use of a custom hook - useReactiveAction(), these basic components can easily get data from other components in the app, to render the appropriate settings and content. They can also be triggered with the new data from other components. This makes state handling and re-rendering more efficient and accessible around the app. The app also has a small backend handling calls to the openai.

I'm available for any questions or ideas to improve :)
